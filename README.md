Send ical calendar invites using your Emacs mail client. These
invites are similar to those produced by Google Calendar, Outlook
Calendar, etc. and are compatible with them.

varuga populates a message mode buffer with an ical MIME part (using
MML, the MIME Meta Language). It also adds a plain text part listing
the time of the event in various configured timezones.

All dates and times you enter into varuga are in your local timezone. varuga automatically converts these into a set of configured timezones (specified in `varuga-clock-list`) for your correspondents' benefit.

# How to use

In a message mode buffer, run `M-x varuga-invite`, fill out the details. The email will be filled out with the ical and plain text parts. Add any other text you like and send!

# Natural language date-time and event duration specification

varuga uses the very flexible `org-read-date` to read the date and
time of the event from a natural language
specification. `org-read-date` assumes that most of the time you want
to enter a date in the future: if you omit the month/year and the
given day/month is *before* today, it assumes that you mean a future
date. See [*The date/time prompt* in the Org mode manual](https://orgmode.org/manual/The-date_002ftime-prompt.html) for more details. Here are a few examples of date-time specifications. All the examples below assume that the current date-time is June 16, 2024 7 am.
